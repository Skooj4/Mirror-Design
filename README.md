For a C:
  For my sketch I decided the mirror would look best with most of the conetn pushed toward either side of the mirror leaving the center of the mirror open for use.

For a B:
  My mirror works through a series of API calls, the clock runs off the computer's internal clock, and the local weather, news feed, use API calls and the calendar uses a CSV.
  
  The mirror's timer shows how long you've been at the mirror

For an A:
  For my advenced feature, I decided to add a color picker light source to the outer border of the mirror itself, allowing the user to to change the lighting if needed.
